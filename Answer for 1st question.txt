State management can be achieved by

1) Sessions
2) Cokkies
3) ServletContext

Sessions : 
	i)   Create Session by using 'HttpSession sessionName' 
	ii)  set maximum inactive interval through 'sessionName.setMaxInactiveInterval(time)'
	iii)  After the request changes to other Servlet get the session by using request.getSession

Cokkies  :
	i)   Cokkies will store a little data
	ii)  For example User name, session Id
	iii) When there is a transaction between client and server cokkies can be used
	iv)  If the communication is between server and server(different files in server), no need to use cokkies

Servlet Context:
	i)   Create a area which is sharable by files by using 'ServletContext shareArea'
	ii)  save the varibles which you want to share by using shareArea.setAttribute(String,Variable);
	iii) In the other where you want to access old values use 'Variable = shareArea.getAttribute(String)';


In the progrAm I have used Servlet Context.
username = saipavan
password = 12345
